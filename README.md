# GatherHub

GatherHub makes communication across the event frictionless. It enables organizers to broadcast announcements, gives participants access to live schedules and relevant event information, and connects peers through a chat.

## Inspiration
When attending conferences, festivals, and other gatherings, in almost all cases, all the events' coordination, planning, and communication are happening on Facebook, Discord, or other closed platforms.

As authors of GatherHub are not big fans of social media, we decided to create a dApp that supplements event organizers with features previously provided only by big platforms.

## How we built

We built GatherHub to be a permissionless interface utilizing already well-established protocols.

The core logic is built on Gnosis Chain, where smart contracts handle administrative tasks for event organizers.

To discover events membership stored on Unlock Protocol, we used Dune Analytics to understand the protocol and its smart contracts.

For storing messages between participants and organizers, we're using Arweave.

We implemented Ramp to accept crypto payments via fiat to handle the business-oriented side of things.

To tie up the interface and operate on multiple chains, we used, Alchemy gateway, UseDapp libraries, and Tenderly Web3 Actions service for Webhook→smart contract interaction.

## Hackathon

This project was build for ETHWarsaw 2022 hackathon.

- The hackathon took place 02.09.2022 18:00 - 04.09.2022 10:00.
- Our team was two Software Engineers.
- We are not running any backend services. Instead, we're leveraging the project with the integrations mentioned below.
- We intentionally left some of the features and code incomplete due to the minimal nature of the event. Please treat this project as a proof of concept.
- During the hackathon, we hacked a project helping organizations such as ETHWarsaw with features described in detail below.
- At the same time, we wanted to learn as much as possible about incredible projects and companies we met with during the hackathon by integrating some of their tech solutions into our project.

The dapp is available under: https://bonnevoyager.github.io/ethwarsaw-hackathon on Gnosis Chain.

What we did technically:
- 🔗 deployed our multi-tiered NFT smart contract on Gnosis Chain, and the address of the contract is [0x41E6Bf6ee23114E7AD790bB2593eC31574696735](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x41E6Bf6ee23114E7AD790bB2593eC31574696735). We didn't even have to use the testnet, because fees were so low!
- 🔐 used https://unlock-protocol.com to fetch ETHWarsaw locks from Optimism chain. Since we deployed our contract on Gnosis Chain, we had a chance to experiment with multiple chains in a single dApp.
- 💬 used https://www.arweave.org for storing the messages. Hello permaweb!
- 💵 used https://ramp.network for one of the features. Super simple integration!
- ⛴ used https://tenderly.co for Webhook->smart contract automation. Fantastic infrastructure project!
- 🤘 used https://usedapp.io for Web3 interactions. Kudos to the creators for filling the tech gap!

### Gnosis Chain

Gnosis Chain turned out to be very cheap. We initially had issues configuring Hardhat and our dApp with Gnosis Chain, but after properly configuring the RPC server, everything went smoothly. We even skipped the testnet and tested our work on the main chain. Because it was so cheap, we started to deploy plain text in our contracts (that's extremely expensive and highly discouraged on Ethereum mainnet). Since we used Optimism for other features, we had an opportunity to connect those two chains for our case, and we think that worked well. For our use case, we fetched all the users attending ETHWarsaw from Unlocked protocol API and deployed a smart contract on Gnosis Chain, extending the event capabilities.

### Tiered NFT Smart Contract

`contracts/Memberships.sol` has an NFT contract that we implemented to extend the functionalities provided by Unlock protocol by tiered access to our dApp. The three tiers are Participant/Speaker/Host, and then there is a contract owner with the most privileges. We didn't implement specific access control logic, so it's currently easy to bypass tiered access logic, which is beyond this PoC. Next to tiered NFT, we also wanted to make it a dynamic NFT (dNFT), but we dropped this idea for the sake of other features described in this document. However, some of the code is still there, and it might be working fine by displaying a numeric digit when shelving the NFT on Opensea, for example.

### Permaweb and messaging

We store user content on Arweave, which provides the ability to cheapy store arbitrary data. Thanks to the robust Arweave dApp gateway, it is possible to publish data quickly, query it, and fetch it. We even managed to create near real-time chat with it!

### Ramp payments system

Ramp allowed us to quickly implement a payment system for business users to join our program. It was trivial to use the Ramp widget to include it in our project allowing the users to enter the crypto world without too much friction.

### Tenderly Webhook->smart contract automation

In one of the features of GatherHub, the Deals, we introduce the projects to the business and allow them to pay for project services using Ramp. Starting such a purchase will send a Webhook to our Tenderly project, which will interact with our Tiered NFT Smart Contract and emit an event used in the dApp. Please find the code for Tenderly under `actions` directory.

### useDApp

useDApp allowed us to integrate Web3 into our dApp without too much hassle. Its hooks are very intuitive and save a lot of time during development. We had issues with interacting with the contract directly, but perhaps that was a configuration issue.
